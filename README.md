Audio-based Emotion Prediction
Project Description
This project aims to predict emotions from audio data using deep learning techniques. We utilize two datasets, CREMA-D and TESS, to train and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying emotions based on speech.

Installation & Requirements
To set up the project environment:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-emotion-prediction.git
cd audio-emotion-prediction
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
For detailed package information, refer to requirements.txt.

Dataset Details
CREMA-D: 7,442 audio samples of emotional speech from 91 actors
TESS: 2,800 audio samples of emotional speech from 2 actresses
Both datasets contain recordings of various emotions including anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral states.

For more information, see data/README.md.

Key Findings (EDA Summary)
Balanced distribution of emotions in both datasets
MFCC features show distinct patterns for different emotions
Spectrograms and waveforms provide visual insights into emotional characteristics of speech
How to Use the Notebook
Open Audio-based-Emotion-Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
Ensure all required libraries are installed (see requirements.txt)
Run cells sequentially to:
Load and preprocess the data
Perform exploratory data analysis
Train the CNN model
Evaluate model performance
Results & Visualizations
The CNN model achieves high accuracy in emotion classification
Visualizations include:
Waveforms and spectrograms of sample audio files
Training and validation accuracy/loss curves
Confusion matrix of model predictions
For detailed results, refer to reports/README.md.

Future Enhancements
Experiment with other deep learning architectures (LSTM, Transformer)
Incorporate transfer learning from pre-trained audio models
Develop a real-time emotion prediction system
Explore multi-modal emotion recognition (combining audio with text or video)
